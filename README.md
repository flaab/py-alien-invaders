# Py-Alien-Invaders
PyAlien Invaders is yet another Python Game coded with PyGame. PyAlien Invaders is a shooter in which the player controls a spaceship by moving it horizontally and vertically across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat all the rows of aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward the bottom of the screen. Each additional level increases the speed of the aliens and decreases the size of the ship's bullets.
